# MyJavaProject
Sushchok Ivan
This is my Java project that prints text on the screen.

## Instructions

1. Install IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Create a new Java project.
3. Open the `Main.java` file.
4. Run the program.
5. You should see the text "Hello, world!" on the screen.

## New Feature: Lorem Ipsum File

I have added a new file called `lorem.txt` to the project, which contains Lorem ipsum text. This file serves as an example or placeholder text commonly used in the design and printing industry.

Thank you for checking out my project!
